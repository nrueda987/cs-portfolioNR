<p id="P1">Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence(AI) game. You control a hero but unlike most games you do not control the bot 
directly, its determined by a string of commands that tells the bot what to do. There are 4 other bots(players) and each player controls one bot. The 
map is randomly generated and you give commands(code) determines whether you go to taverns, collect gold, or attack othe bots. You are able to steal mines 
from other players and collect gold from the mines. When your bot is low health it is able to go to a tavern and regain health but it does spend the
 coins that the bot collected from the mines. The game is turn based 300 turns each player so 1200 turns in total. The game is very simple but can get 
 very competitive and each player is able to customize each bot to their liking. I believe there are only 3 ways bots can go aggressive which is the player
 creates a code where the bot attacks other bots. Theres the balance of a little of attacking, collecting coins, and also going to tavern. And lastly
 conservative where the bot mostly stay near a tavern and collects gold but doesn't really attack other bots. Oh and the way to win the game is at the
  end of all 1200 turns whomever has the most gold wins the game.</p>

<p id="P1">There are three main parts to this code. 
The first part is the global data section. This is where the bot has code that allows it to assess the 
state of the game and its surroundings, such 
as whether once the bot reaches a certain health if it needs to go to a tavern, 
if theres an empty mine, and where the closest player is. The second part is the WHAT section. This is where the bot does the actual 
decision making on what to do depending on the code that the player inputs. It may decide to go to a tavern because it is low on health or 
maybe it will attack a player because it is 
within two units of it. Situations where the bot
doesn't do what it should be doing are usually because there is a problem with the code. The code needs to be specific and not overlap each 
other or else the bot will get confused and may not do what you wanted it to do. 
The final section is the HOW section. By now, the bot has picked a decision to make but now it must carry out that decision. The code in this 
section tells the bot what to do for the decision it made. For example, 
if the bot decides to attack another bot, the code in the HOW section will change its path to go collect gold at mines.</p>

<div id="Decision making"><h2 id="coding_section">The Code for Decision Making</h2>

<pre><code> var task;
        if (bot.yourBot.life < 25) {
            task = "tavern";
        }
        else if (bot.yourBot.life > 75) {
            task = "goAttack";
        }
        else {
            task = "freemines";
        }
        </code></pre>
        
<p id="P1">This code is the task that the bot is suppose to take. The task is based on different conditions that the bot might face.
Such as going to a tavern. Create an if statement then write the condition of when the bot goes to a tavern. So if the bot
has less than 50 health go to a tavern, using the condition "bot.yourBot.life <= 25" and then have the task "go to tavern". This whole could 
basically
states that the maisn task is if my bots health is less than 25 it should go to tavern. the second command is that if the bot has 
more than 75 health it will go attack another bot. Lastly, and the simple one if there is a freemine around it will go collect gold.</p>

    <div id="Taverns"><h2 id="coding_section">Taverns</h2>
    
  <pre><code>if (task === "tavern") {
            var closesttavern = bot.tavern[0];
            for (i = 0; i < bot.tavern.length; i++) {
                if (bot.findDistance(myPos, closesttavern) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.tavern[i])) {
                    closesttavern = bot.tavern[i];

            </code></pre>
            
  <p id="P1">This code locates the positions of all the taverns and 
  determines which one is closer to my Bot. The if statement in this task tells my bot to got to the nearest tavern.
  The console.logs is a notification telling you when your bot is going to a Tavern.</p>
  
   <div id="Mines"><h2 id="coding_section">Claiming Free Mines</h2>
  
  <pre><code> if (task === "freemines") {
            var closestMine = bot.freeMines[0];
            for (i = 0; i < bot.freeMines.length; i++) {

            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestMine);
        }
        </code></pre>
  
  <p id="P1"> The code for the mine finds the closest mine that is not taken by another enemy bot and goes to that mine and claims it. 
  It determines if the mine is free by using an array. 
  My bot then looks at all the free mines and locates the closet one and then it sends it to that mine.</p>

    
     <div id="Attack"><h2 id="coding_section">Attacking</h2>
    
    <pre><code> if (task === "goAttack") {

            </code></pre>
    
    <p id="P1">The decision making if statement says that if my bot's health is higher than 75 it will go attack the closest bot. 
    This code also uses an array but instead of looking for taverns or mines it looks for the position of enemy bots. But if my health is under 
    50 my bot will stop attacking and go to closest tavern.</p>

        <div id="AI"><h2 id="coding_section"> What Have I Learned about AI</h2>
  
 
<p id="P1">My bot did do what i wanted it to do because in one of the games I participated in 
I won the game so I would say yes my bot did do what I wnated it to do.
This whole Vindinium project was complicated but, really once you got into it it was simple to understand.
My understanding was pretty complicated as I said before but simple once understood more. 
This project was actually a lot of fun and interesting because of the AI and how you have to use a string of commands instead of controlling the 
the bot directly.
