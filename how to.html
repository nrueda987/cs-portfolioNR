<p id="P1">This code is the task that the bot is suppose to take. The task is based on different conditions that the bot might face.
Such as going to a tavern. Create an if statement then write the condition of when the bot goes to a tavern. So if the bot
has less than 50 health go to a tavern, using the condition "bot.yourBot.life <= 25" and then have the task "go to tavern/".</p>
<br>
<p id="P1">The code for the mine finds the closes mine that is not taken by another enemy bot and goes to that mine and claims it. It determines if the mine is free
 by using an array but in this code it measures the distance between my bots position, "myPos", to the mine which is determined by "closestMine". And this code determines the positions of the mines in the an array
  and measures the distance between the mines and my bot.</p>
<br>
<p id="P1"> The next code is attacking another player's bot. The code says "clossetemenybot.posarray", this code is also an array but instead of looking for taverns or mines
 it looks for enemy bot. This code specifically targets enemy bots that are closes to my bots. But if my health is under 50 it will prioritize the health over the bot and its will do that for mines too because of the "if task". </p>
